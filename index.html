  <h1><span>WHERE IS HOME?</span></h1>

    <p>During different historic periods of time, people migrated for different reasons: wars made people flee their homes because of danger and looking for safety, various economic crisis made them migrate looking for a better life in terms of economic conditions. In many cases now people move simply because the global and open world lets us do so.
    
    <p>According to UN Population Fund data in 2015, 244 million people, or 3,3% of the worldâ€™s population lived outside their country of origin.</p>
    <p>In many cases home is no longer just about the physical place, it's about <span>rituals we do</span>, <span>relationships we have</span> and about <span>where our soul belongs</span>.</p>
